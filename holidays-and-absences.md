# Holidays

GRAPIN’s employees have 25 days of holidays per year.

You should communicate any holiday period by filling out [this form](https://testcloud.grapin.ch/index.php/f/205209), print it out, and give it to Karin or Sonja. 

Holidays will be officially aproved only after Hans Jörg signes and sends you back the form. Eventually Hans Jörg will check the dates together with your project leader. 

After that, Karin or Sonja will introduce the approved dates into the *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*.

### Project Planning Support
Longer holiday periods (i.e. Christmas or summer holidays) should be communicated before the end of January. This way you'll support the good usage of *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*, thus a better oversight of your availability and project planning.

Please think of discussing your *longer holiday periods* with your project leader (and the rest of the team) before sending it to Karin (or Sonja)! 

### Overtime
By default, overtime is compensated with extra holidays. In fact, *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool* automatically _accrues_ your extra time the first day of the month. For any concern about the compensation method, please get in touch with Hans Jörg.

# Absences
Absences due to illnes, militar or civil services, or any other personal matter will be communicated to either to Hans Jörg or to your project leader.

After checking the supporting documents, Karin or Sonja will introduce the *absence* dates into *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*.
