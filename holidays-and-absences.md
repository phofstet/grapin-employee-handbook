# Holidays

GRAPIN’s employees have 25 days of holidays per year.

You should communicate any holiday period by filling out [this form (private link)](https://storage.grapin.ch/s/YWLFibdKQkeeJ6W), print it out, and give it to the person you report to (see ). 

Holidays will be officially aproved only after the person you report to signs and sends you back the form.

At the same time, the person who aproves and signes the form will communicate Sonja the aproved holidays, who will introduce the dates into the *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*.

### Project Planning Support
Longer holiday periods (i.e. Christmas or summer holidays) should be communicated before the end of January. This way you'll support the good usage of *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*, thus a better oversight of your availability and project planning.

### Overtime
By default, overtime can only be compensated with free days. In fact, *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool* automatically _accrues_ your extra time the very first day of the month, but you should never have more than 25 days of holidays approved. 

For any concern about the compensation method, please get in touch with Hans Jörg.

# Absences
Absences due to illnes, militar or civil services, or any other personal matter will be communicated to the person you report to.

After checking the supporting documents, the person who received the form will inform Sonja, who will introduce the dates into *GRAPIN’s Project Management Tool*.
