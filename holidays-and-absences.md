# Holidays

GRAPIN’s employees have 25 days of holidays per year.

You should communicate any holiday period by filling out [this form (private link)](https://storage.grapin.ch/s/YWLFibdKQkeeJ6W), print it out, and give it to the person you report to (see ). 

Holidays will be officially aproved only after the person you report to signs and sends you back the form.

At the same time, the person who aproves and signes the form will communicate Sonja the aproved holidays, who will introduce the dates into the *GRAPIN’s Time Tracking Tool*.

### Project Planning Support
Longer holiday periods (i.e. Christmas or summer holidays) should be communicated before the end of January. This way you'll support the good usage of *GRAPIN’s Time Tracking Tool*, thus a better oversight of your availability and project planning.

### Overtime
We limit ourselves to a 42-hour work week. Keeping our hours at work limited forces us to prioritize the work that really matters.

THere are occasions where teams or individuals need to work off-hours, but this time should not be in addition to your normal working hours.

Our *GRAPIN’s Time Tracking Tool* will help you to track your hours and identify when and why you have worked more than normal. 

Use your discretion to take time off to make up for the additional hours you put in during the week. Although *GRAPIN’s Time Tracking Tool* automatically _accrues_ your extra time the very first day of the month, it is your responsability to:

1. Don't accumulate more than 25 days of holidays approved,
2. Try to have zero *Days to Compensate* (see both on the *Workers Report* tab of the tool).

For any concern about the compensation method, please get in touch with Hans Jörg.

# Absences
Absences due to illnes, militar or civil services, or any other personal matter will be communicated to the person you report to.

After checking the supporting documents, the person who received the form will inform Sonja, who will introduce the dates into *GRAPIN’s Time Tracking Tool*.
