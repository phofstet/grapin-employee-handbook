# GRAPIN’s Tools
We have a number of internal tools that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

* [Basecamp](#basecamp)
* [Github](#github)
* [Markdown](#markdown)
* [Microsoft Exchange](#microsoft-exchange)
* [Project Management Tool](#project-management-tool)

Basecamp is the cornerstone of GRAPIN’s project management tools. Given its importance, we list below a list of best practices that everyone should follow:

1. [Install Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/via) apps on both your computer (desktop version) and your smartphone,
2. Proceed with Bascamp’s [Basic Setup](#basic-setup) by disabling email notifications and verifying the correct functioning of the notifications on your smartphone,
3. Basecamp apps (desktop and smartphone) should be always open (or running in background) as you usually do with your favourite email client. This is very important!
4. Basecamp should replace emails for internal communications. As a first preference use messages on the [Message Board](https://3.basecamp.com/4114267/buckets/9523970/message_boards/1365759684) for communication purposes. If you need immediate feedback, use then _pings_ or the proper [Campfire](https://3.basecamp.com/4114267/buckets/9523970/chats/1365759681).  Emails are old-fashined, get lost, create bottelnecks, and they are definitely not the right tool for internal communication!
5. For meetings with only internal members, try to use Basecamp’s [Schedule](https://3.basecamp.com/4114267/buckets/9523970/schedules/1365759692) as much as possible. Basecamp’s Schedule events allow you to easily document meeting’s conclusions by creating cross references to people, documents, or other meetings,
6. In any case, add your personal Basecamp’s Schedule to your GRAPIN’s Exchange account (follow [this link](#adding-your-basecamp-schedule) for further details),
7. In regards to Tasks: always asign the task to someone (that is probably yourself!), try to avoid to assign a task for multiple people—and also to create groups on _tasks lists_,

## Basecamp

### Basic Setup
As mentioned above, setting up Basecamp basically means to ensure that:

1. You disable email notifications,
2. You ensure your notifications are properly working on your smartphone, and that
3. You add your personal Basecamp’s Schedule to your GRAPIN’s Exchange.

Watch the videos [Basic Setup](https://github.com/grapin/handbook/raw/master/tools/basecamp/basic-setup.mov) and [Adding your Basecamp Schedule](https://github.com/grapin/handbook/raw/master/tools/basecamp/adding-your-basecamp-schedule.mov).

### Tasks
Tasks and lists are the most important things on Basecamp—as they basically collect the work to be done to achieve your goals. As mentioned above, there are some recommendations when you are creating tasks:

1. Always asign the task to someone,
2. Try to avoid to assign a task for multiple people, and
3. Try to avoid to create groups on _tasks lists_.

Besides the owner of the task, you can also select:

1. Who to notify when the task is done,
2. When the task should be completed, i.e. by entering a _Due on_, and
3. A task description.

In the case you select a _Due on_, you will see that task in both your _Basecamp Schedule_ and your _Exchange Calendar_ (if you have properly followed [this](#adding-your-basecamp-schedule)).

As we all want to work independetly (but giving enough information to our colleagues about what we are working on), always add a description of the task on the _Notes_ section.

Watch the video [Creating Tasks](https://github.com/grapin/handbook/raw/master/tools/basecamp/creating-tasks.mov). 

### Tracked
[Tracked for Basecamp](https://www.trackedhq.com) is a plug-in that enables Kanban boards on Basecamp. This plug-in is only available for Chrome or compatible browsers.

In order to install Tracked, please do the following:

1. Install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tracked-for-basecamp/chmeecgnmbnijigjhhgedjljgkgblmpo),
2. Ask for an email invitation to Patrick or Javi, and follow the instructions there.

## Github
[...]

### Jekyll
Jekyll is web service that creates html servers from markdown files. Jekyll is written with ruby and we would need to be sure that we have all the ruby-libraries properly installed.

## Microsoft Exchange
Microsoft Exchange is a collection of applications that enable digital messaging and collaboration in an enterprise IT environment. At GRAPIN we use Microsoft Exchange ("Exchange") for emails and calendars.

_It is important to remark at this point that the old DC-ONE account should not be used anymore (neither for emails nor for calendars)._

### Email
Use your GRAPIN Exchange email account as you are used to—but keeping in mind the 4th point of the list above.

### Calendars: Sharing and Permissions
For properly sharing our calendar details, we need to be sure that people on GRAPIN can see all the deails in our Calendar. For doing that we need to navigate to _Sharing and permissions_ and set _Can view all details_ for _People in my organisation_.

Watch the video [Sharing and Permissions](https://github.com/grapin/handbook/raw/master/tools/exchange/sharing-and-permissions.mov).

### Adding your Basecamp Schedule
In order to give full transparency, it is important to add our Basecamp Schedule  to GRAPIN’s Exchange. 

For doing that, you should do the following:

1. Get your calendar address on Basecamp,
2. Login onto your Exchange account, navigate to your _Calendar_ and click on _Import calendar_,
3. Click on _Import from web_, and
4. Add your calendar address details.

Watch the video [Adding your Basecamp Schedule](https://github.com/grapin/handbook/raw/master/tools/basecamp/adding-your-basecamp-schedule.mov).
