# Documentation

For file sharing and overall record, we use Nextcloud and Office 365. Office 365 integrates on Basecamp, and we use it for generating documents in collaboration with colleagues inside and outside of GRAPIN. For [Technical Documentation](#technical-dcoumentation), please refer to the section below. 

Besides of this public handbook, we maintain the following two other repositories on Github:

1. [GRAPIN Cloud Handbook](https://github.com/grapin/grapin-cloud-handbook), and
2. GRAPIN Cloud Wiki.

The first one is a public resource where we explain the most relevant topics for appropriate usage of our GRAPIN Cloud infrastructure. The second one is a private share-point for an internal knowledge base and critical documentation—we mostly use the Github’s wiki for that.

## Technical Documentation
 
 All the technical documentation is under version control on Github. Every repository has a `/docs` folder where we place all the markdown documents that explain the technical principles—and the code itself—of our solution. We believe the documentation is as relevant as the code.

 This way, with [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com), we can [generate LaTeX documents](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writing_Markdown_in_LaTeX_Documents) quickly from the markdown files checked on each repository.

 # Summary

 Please follow the following rules:

 * For file sharing and overall record, please use Basecamp’s *Docs & Files* (and the *Message Board*), Nextcloud, and Office 365 (in this order). Using Office 365 integration on Basecamp is especially convenient for collaboration purposes. Please take into consideration the use of OneNote as your technical diary tool. 

* As a GRAPIN employee, make proper use of the GRAPIN Cloud Wiki as a knowledge base share-point and wiki.

* For technical documentation, use the proper Github repositories together with Overleaf.
