# Documentation

For file sharing and general documentation we use Nextcloud and Office 365. Office 365 integrates on Basecamp and we use it for generating documents in collaboration with colleagues inside and outside of GRAPIN.

## Technical Documentation
 
 All the technical documentation is under version control on Github. Each and every repository has a `/docs` folder were we place all the markdown documents that explains the technical principles—and the code itself—of our solution. We belive the documentation is as important as the code.

 This way, with [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com) we are able to [generate LaTeX documents](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writing_Markdown_in_LaTeX_Documents) easily from the markdown files checked on each repository.
