# Documentation

For file sharing and overall record, we use Nextcloud and Office 365. Office 365 integrates on Basecamp, and we use it for generating documents in collaboration with colleagues inside and outside of GRAPIN.

## Technical Documentation
 
 All the technical documentation is under version control on Github. Every repository has a `/docs` folder where we place all the markdown documents that explain the technical principles—and the code itself—of our solution. We believe the documentation is as relevant as the code.

 This way, with [Overleaf](www.overleaf.com), we can [generate LaTeX documents](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Writing_Markdown_in_LaTeX_Documents) quickly from the markdown files checked on each repository.
