# Judo
Most problems can be solved in a thousand different ways. One way might take 100 hours, another might take 10. Judo is the art of problem restatement. Turning that massive, scary 3-month looking problem into one that can be done in 3 weeks instead. It's often used when we get frustrated trying to solve something hard and we aren't making sufficient progress: "Let's figure out a way to judo this!".
