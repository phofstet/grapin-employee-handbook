With this simple handbook we pretend to clarify not only to our employees—but also partners and investors—who we are as a company (what’s our culture, process, and history), what do we stand for?, and how should we work.

Most of our practices are highly biased by [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com)—the tool we use for project management and company communications—, and the work methodology they enforce with it (which is called Shape Up). You’ll find more in the section [How We Work](how-we-work.md). 

If you are reading this *employee’s handbook* you have probably started working or collaborating with us: thanks for that!
