# What We Stand For

Digitalization and big data are pushing the existing inhouse infrastructure as well as high-performance computing technologies to its limits. An increasing amount of both private and business activities are handled digitally, requiring secure but comfortable and from everywhere accessible enhanced computing performance and data storage. Nevertheless, many companies, as well as private clients, are still managing their data and IT infrastructure in a conservative way. The reasons for this are various. Focusing on the customer, they might fear losing flexibility as well as control over their data and systems and being faced with huge expenses. Suppliers, on the other hand, are not able to offer scalable and secure operable Data Center and high-performance computing solutions.  

Today’s supercomputers are mostly designed for large institutions and are not accessible to medium and small institutions and individuals such as students, startups, IT enterprises, or R&D professionals. By developing further existing state-of-the-art FPGAs—and offering them in a disaggregated way in our modern hyper-scale data centers—GRAPIN aims to grant access to high-performance computing services to a broader range of people in an efficient, flexible, and scalable way. 

## Vision

Our Vision is to be globally recognized as pioneers and leading experts in high-performance computing, creating value by providing the world’s most sophisticated hardware-acceleration solutions to solve our client’s computing challenges.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a flexible, power- and cost-efficient infrastructure for high-performance computing in the cloud. A simple yet sophisticated dashboard exposes our unique and holistic FPGA-computing platform, allowing our customers not only to tailor and handle their supercomputing resources on-demand but also to manage their acceleration workloads.

## Values

### Self-Responsiveness

Our modern and liberal corporate culture allows a lot of freedom, individuality as well as opportunities for self-actualization. Living in such an environment works, if everyone takes responsibility for his or her tasks and areas.

### Reliability
We are working in a highly competitive, agile, and professional environment, whereby the reliability of our products and services, as well as our team, is a crucial factor for joint success!

### Open Communication
The cross-cultural background of our team provides many chances and advantages but also bears some risks. These risks can be limited to a minimum by an open communication!

### Open-Mindedness
We are operating in a fast-moving and innovative environment, where we always need to observe current developments and think two steps ahead. 

### Flexibility

Since we are still a young and small enterprise, we do not command a professional tool for every single task. This fact keeps our processes simple but demands certain flexibility.

### Creativity

Operating in a solution-oriented business area, where our customers’ challenges are very individual, demands a high level of creativity.
