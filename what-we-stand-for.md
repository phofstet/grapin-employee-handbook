# What We Stand For

## Vision

Our Vision is to be globally recognized as pioneers and leading experts in high-performance computing, creating value by providing the world’s most sophisticated hardware-acceleration solutions to solve our client’s computing challenges.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a flexible, power- and cost-efficient infrastructure for high-performance computing in the cloud. A simple yet sophisticated dashboard exposes our unique and holistic FPGA-computing platform, allowing our customers not only to tailor and handle their supercomputing resources on-demand but also to manage their acceleration workloads.

## Values

### Self-Responsiveness

Our modern and liberal corporate culture allows a lot of freedom, individuality as well as opportunities for self-actualization. Living in such an environment works, if everyone takes responsibility for his or her tasks and areas.

### Reliability
We are working in a highly competitive, agile, and professional environment, whereby the reliability of our products and services, as well as our team, is a crucial factor for joint success!

### Open Communication
The cross-cultural background of our team provides many chances and advantages but also bears some risks. These risks can be limited to a minimum by an open communication!

### Open-Mindedness
We are operating in a fast-moving and innovative environment, where we always need to observe current developments and think two steps ahead. 

### Flexibility

Since we are still a young and small enterprise, we do not command a professional tool for every single task. This fact keeps our processes simple but demands certain flexibility.

### Creativity

Operating in a solution-oriented business area, where our customers’ challenges are very individual, demands a high level of creativity.
