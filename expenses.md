# Expenses

GRAPIN will pay bills related to projects when they are properly justified. To do this, you must fill out [this form](https://testcloud.grapin.ch/index.php/f/205210), print it out, and give it to Karin or Sonja—along with the supporting documents for each expense—.

When averything works out, you will receive the expenses aproved amount within a second transfer the same day you receive your next salary payment.
