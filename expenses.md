# Expenses

GRAPIN will pay project related expenses when properly justified. To do this, you should fill out [this form (private link)](https://storage.grapin.ch/index.php/f/222253), print it out, and give it to Sonjaâ€”together with the supporting documents for each expense.

When everything works out, you will receive the aproved amount within a second transfer along with your next salary payment. 

In any other case, Karin or Sonja will contact you by email.
