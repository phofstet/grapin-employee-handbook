# Expenses

GRAPIN will pay bills related to projects when they are properly justified. To do this, you must fill out [this form](), print it out, and give it to [Karin](mailto:karin@grapin.ch) or [Sonja](mailto:sonja@grapin.ch)—along with the supporting documents for each expense—.

After a final agreement you will receive a second transfer the same day you receive your salary for the following month.
